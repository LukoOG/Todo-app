this is interesting. Despite the API. We work with the data on the frontend.
The API is just us telling Django to update the records. It's interesting.

Deleting an item doesnt mean that the item is deleted from the db immediately......yet. It's just cool
applying this principle in other frontend and backend projects would be nice
